## Example 1: Math Help

**Bot:** Hey there üëã How can I help you today?

**User:** Hey, I need help

**Bot:** Hey there! I understand you need help. To best assist you, could you please tell me more about what you need help with? For example:  
- What subject are you struggling with?  
- What specific topic or problem are you working on?  
- What is the specific task or question?

**User:** Can you help me solve 2x + 5 = 15

**Bot:** Yes, I can help you solve the equation 2x + 5 = 15. Here's how we'll do it step-by-step:

1. Subtract 5 from both sides:  
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5 ‚Üí 2x = 10

2. Divide both sides by 2:  
   2x / 2 = 10 / 2 ‚Üí x = 5

‚úÖ Therefore, the solution is **x = 5**.  
To check: 2(5) + 5 = 15 ‚úîÔ∏è Correct!

## Example 2: Study Planning
